RUNNING THE MULTITHREADER >>>>

1>Open the Zip file and Unzip it to a directory.. Make sure you use the Use Folder Names option (If you are using WinZip)

2>Open MThread.vbp and compile it... In case VB complains about some references, select Project -> References, and click browse... Select ThreadAPI.tlb and click OK... Now recompile it....

3>Open MThreadDemo.vbp and compile it... As before, VB might complain about references... In this case, select Project ->References, click browse, select MThreadVB.Dll and click OK.Now recompile it....

4>Please make sure that as far as possible run all multithreaded EXEs that you create as standalone EXEs, and NOT within the IDE since within the IDE some operations, such as Thread termination APIs cause the IDE to misbehave...

Thought you can perform file I/O and show forms from multithreader procedures, I do not very much recommend it...

Please read the HTML file included for more info on this software....
